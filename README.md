## Overview

This project serves as a foundational Python client for interacting with the Buckzy API. It abstracts the complexities of HTTP requests and JSON handling, allowing developers to focus on integrating Buckzy's financial services into their applications. The client covers essential functionalities such as managing customer profiles, handling financial accounts, processing payout transactions, and retrieving real-time exchange rates.

## Features

The current implementation of the Buckzy API Python Client includes support for the following core functionalities as specified:

* **1. Entity Documents Management**: Provides methods to upload, retrieve, and list documents associated with various entities (e.g., KYC documents for customers).
* **2. Customer Management (Individual, Corporate)**: Enables the creation, retrieval, and updating of both individual and corporate customer profiles within the Buckzy system.
* **3. SPOT Rates**: Offers functionality to fetch real-time foreign exchange spot rates for specified currency pairs.
* **4. Buckzy Account Management**: Supports the creation of new Buckzy internal accounts, retrieval of their detailed information, and querying of their current balances.
* **5. Payout Transaction Endpoint**: Facilitates the initiation of new money payout transactions and allows for checking the real-time status of these transactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this client, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3.7+**: This client is developed and tested with Python 3.7 and newer versions.
* **`requests` library**: This is a powerful and user-friendly HTTP library for Python, essential for making API calls.
* **`python-dotenv` (Recommended)**: For securely managing environment variables, especially API keys.

You can install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
